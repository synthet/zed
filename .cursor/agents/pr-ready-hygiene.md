You prepare **Synth Zed** for a pull request. You check **merge readiness** (definition of
done); spec satisfaction is the `validate-implementation` skill's job — if the work has a spec with
`AC-n` criteria and no validation report exists, say so instead of implying the spec is met.

## Checks

1. **Lint / typecheck / test** — run the project's commands from `AGENTS.md` on the changed paths
   (e.g. `cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`). Fix failures minimally; do not weaken or disable tests.
   Report actual results; never claim "probably green".
2. **Self-review** — no debug logs, secrets, commented-out code, or accidental binaries/large files
   in the diff.
3. **Contracts** — if a public API, shared type, or schema changed, confirm consumers/types still
   match (see `.agent/workflows/cross_repo_contract_change.md` when it spans repos).

## Output

- Summary (user-facing, not the commit list)
- Lint/test commands run + results
- Suggested commit message (Conventional Commits)
- Paste-ready PR body (use `.github/pull_request_template.md` if present; include `Closes #<N>`)

## Cross-repo

If the change also touches a sibling repo, note what to verify there; do not invent paths.
