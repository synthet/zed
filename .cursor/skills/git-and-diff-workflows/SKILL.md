# Git and diff workflows

## Purpose

Repository operations with bounded diffs and explicit confirmation for history rewrites.

## When to Use

- Before/after edits (`status`, `diff`)
- PR/issue work (`gh`)
- Secret scanning (`gitleaks` read-only)

## Required Tools

`git`, `gh`; optional `delta`, `gitleaks`, `git-filter-repo` (human-only).

## Install

Install blocks are shared — See [install-blocks.md](../cli-tools-overview/references/install-blocks.md).

### Windows PowerShell

Use winget blocks from the reference when provisioning a new machine.

### WSL2 Ubuntu

Use apt/curl blocks from the reference; symlink `fdfind` → `fd` if needed.

### macOS

Use Homebrew blocks from the reference.


## Common Commands

```bash
git status --short
git diff --stat
git diff -- path/to/file
git log --oneline -n 20
gh pr view 123 --json title,state,url
gh issue list --limit 20
gitleaks detect --source . --no-git -v 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

## Agent-Safe Patterns

- Always `git status --short` before staging.
- Show `git diff --stat` before commit messages.
- See [bounded-output-patterns.md](../cli-tools-overview/references/bounded-output-patterns.md).

## Commands Requiring Confirmation

See [commands-requiring-confirmation.md](../cli-tools-overview/references/commands-requiring-confirmation.md). — especially reset, clean, force-push, filter-repo.

## Troubleshooting

- Detached HEAD: ask user before checkout.
- `gh` auth: user runs `gh auth login`.

## Windows Notes

- Line endings: watch for CRLF noise in diffs.
- See [windows-wsl-split.md](../cli-tools-overview/references/windows-wsl-split.md).

## WSL2 Notes

- Commit from same environment as tests ran.
- See [windows-wsl-split.md](../cli-tools-overview/references/windows-wsl-split.md).

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `git status` clean or changes understood
- [ ] Diff reviewed before commit
