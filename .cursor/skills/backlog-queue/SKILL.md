# Backlog queue

The canonical task queue is the project's configured **backlog provider**, not ad hoc `TODO.md`
notes. Provider docs live in [`.agent/backlog/`](../../../.agent/backlog/README.md). Resolve the
provider in this order:

1. Use the provider explicitly named by the user or project docs.
2. Otherwise use GitHub Issues for GitHub-hosted repos with issue tracking enabled.
3. Otherwise use Local Markdown for generic/offline projects.
4. Use GitHub Projects only when the project explicitly adopts that optional board provider.

## When to use

- The user asks to pick the next task, start work, or "what's next".
- The user asks to file a new backlog item.
- A PR is being prepared and needs an item reference.
- A task has hit a blocker, is ready for review, or is finished.
- The user mentions a provider status such as Ready, Claimed, In Progress, Blocked, Review, or Done.
- An agent picks up a task without a corresponding backlog item — stop and file one first.

Treat Ready/Claimed/In Progress/Blocked/Review/Done as logical states. Map them to the selected
provider's fields, labels, table columns, or workflow statuses instead of assuming a GitHub Projects
`Stage` field exists.

## Generic five-step contract

Every contributor (human or AI) follows the same five steps. Do **all** of them; skipping a step
puts the queue out of sync.

### 1. Pick from the ready queue

Open the configured provider and pick the highest-priority unassigned ready item. If the ready queue
is empty, stop and ask the maintainer to promote or create work. **Do not invent new work.**

### 2. Claim the item

Use `/task-claim <item-ref>` (preferred) or the provider-specific claim flow. Claiming must record an
owner/assignee before work begins. Do not require GitHub Projects IDs unless GitHub Projects is the
selected provider.

### 3. Mark in progress on first commit

Move the item to the provider's in-progress state on the first commit.

### 4. If blocked, mark + comment

Move the item to the provider's blocked state and record the reason plus the unblock condition.

### 5. PR references the item

Your PR description must reference the backlog item. Use `Closes #<N>` for GitHub Issues when the PR
fully resolves the issue; use `Refs <ID>` for local or partial work. Move the item to the provider's
review/done state according to that provider's rules.

## Provider references

- Local Markdown: [`.agent/backlog/providers/local-markdown.md`](../../../.agent/backlog/providers/local-markdown.md)
- GitHub Issues: [`.agent/backlog/providers/github-issues.md`](../../../.agent/backlog/providers/github-issues.md)
- GitHub Projects: [`.agent/backlog/providers/github-projects.md`](../../../.agent/backlog/providers/github-projects.md)

## Don'ts

- **Don't** add tasks to random `TODO.md` files.
- **Don't** start work without claiming a provider-backed item.
- **Don't** silently abandon a claimed or in-progress item — mark it blocked with the unblock condition.
- **Don't** open a PR without a backlog reference.
- **Don't** embed provider-specific IDs or board commands in generic workflow docs; put them under `.agent/backlog/providers/`.
- **Don't** treat missing optional-provider IDs (for example GitHub Projects field IDs) as setup blockers for Local Markdown or GitHub Issues.

## Mirrors

This skill is mirrored to `.cursor/skills/backlog-queue/SKILL.md` and
`.agents/skills/backlog-queue/SKILL.md`. `.claude/` is canonical — regenerate both mirrors via
`python scripts/sync_assistant_trees.py`.
