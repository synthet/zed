# Autonomous run contract

Supervised work is governed by the `/spec → /plan → /implement` loop. **Unattended** work is not —
nobody reads the intermediate steps, so the constraints have to be written down before the run
starts. This skill produces that contract.

The premise: the bottleneck in an autonomous run is rarely the next model call. It is where memory
and evaluation live. A loop remembers only the current state; durable history, a visible metric, and
a revert path are what make repeated iteration converge instead of drift.

## When to use

- "Run it overnight", "keep going until the tests pass", "iterate on this without asking me"
- Fan-out across many files/documents/hypotheses, or spawning several subagents
- Any loop that will commit, mutate state, or spend budget between human checkpoints
- Deciding whether a task even needs orchestration beyond a single call

## Gate — can success be verified?

If there is no test, metric, rubric, or source requirement that separates better from worse, **stop
and define one, or keep the human in the loop**. Autonomy without a verifiable signal produces
activity, not progress. Say this plainly rather than starting the run.

Then confirm the other three loop preconditions:

- **Reversible** — every step can be undone (`git reset` to the last retained commit, or equivalent).
- **Short horizon** — one iteration finishes fast enough to give frequent feedback.
- **Bounded environment** — the action space is narrowed by scope, not by hope.

## Step 1 — Pick the smallest architecture that fits

| Situation | Start with | Why |
|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Simple, low-risk question | Single call | Lowest latency; no machinery to debug |
| Output can be checked | **Loop** (generate → evaluate → revise) | Repeated feedback improves the artifact |
| Steps are stable and ordered | Chain | Predictable, testable stages |
| Clear input categories | Router | Separates policies per category |
| Subtasks are independent | Parallel fan-out | Reduces wall-clock time |
| Decomposition varies per run | Orchestrator + workers | Dynamic specialization |
| Alternatives must stay alive | Commit DAG / branches | Preserves lineage instead of forcing one winner |
| Facts must survive the session | Persisted artifacts + graph | Transcript summaries are not memory |

Escalate a level only when the current one has demonstrably failed. More agents increase activity
and opacity before they increase quality.

## Step 2 — Write the run contract

Before the first iteration, state all of these in the task thread (or a scratch file under
[`.agent/scratch/`](../../../.agent/scratch/)). This is the natural-language program the run executes:

- **Objective** — one sentence, testable.
- **Mutable files** — what the run may edit.
- **Protected files** — what it may not touch (evaluation harness, fixtures, config, CI).
- **Metric and direction** — exact command and the number/verdict it produces; better = higher/lower.
- **Run command** — how one iteration is executed and how its output is parsed.
- **Keep-or-revert rule** — improvement is retained as a commit; regression or crash is reverted.
- **Crash policy** — fix if mechanical, else revert and record; never leave the tree dirty.
- **History** — where each iteration's parent state, change, metric, and verdict are recorded.
- **Escalation** — the conditions that require a human (see below).
- **Exhaustion** — what "no more ideas" looks like, so the run stops instead of churning.

## Step 3 — Declare a budget

No unattended run starts without explicit limits. State the ones that apply:

| Limit | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Iterations / model calls | 20 iterations |
| Concurrent workers, total workers | 4 concurrent, 24 total |
| Wall-clock | 90 minutes |
| Retries per failure | 2, then revert |
| Tool/command calls, token or cost ceiling | as the platform allows |
| Minimum evidence to finalize | fresh green test output per retained change |

When a budget is exhausted, **return the best current artifact, the completed work, the unresolved
issues, and the reason for stopping.** Do not hide partial failure behind a fluent summary — that is
the same honesty rule as [`verification-before-completion`](../verification-before-completion/SKILL.md),
applied to the run as a whole.

## Step 4 — Ratchet, one change at a time

Each iteration: inspect state → propose **one** motivated change → apply → evaluate → keep or revert
→ record. One change per iteration is what makes the metric attributable; batching changes destroys
the signal that justifies keeping them.

Two failure modes to guard against:

- **The metric is gamed.** A ratchet improves only what it can see. Carry the constraints that are
  not in the metric (runtime, memory, public interfaces, security) as revert conditions, not as
  hopes.
- **Judgment gets frozen into rules.** If a step needs a heuristic to stay correct, it stays with the
  model — the same boundary [`/compile-skill`](../../commands/compile-skill.md) draws for harnesses.

## Fan-out extras

- **Define the reducer before the fan-out.** Decide how findings will be merged, deduplicated, and
  ranked before any worker starts; otherwise you get N reports and no answer.
- **Every handoff is an artifact contract.** Workers return structured findings with evidence, not
  prose verdicts. A reviewer that returns "looks good" produced nothing.
- **A verification wave only helps if it differs** — a different prompt, evidence set, or role.
  Re-running the same prompt reproduces the same blind spot in parallel.
- **Do not fragment coherent work.** Architecture design, tightly coupled refactors, and narrative
  writing degrade when split into isolated contexts. Fan out over genuinely independent units.

## Escalate to a human

Stop and ask, regardless of remaining budget, when the run would: push, tag, or publish; mutate
GitHub or any remote; export repo content to an external service; change a protected file; or
disable/weaken the evaluation it is being judged by. See [`.agent/SAFETY.md`](../../../.agent/SAFETY.md).

## Report when the run ends

State the objective, iterations used vs. budgeted, retained changes with their metric deltas,
reverted attempts worth knowing about, open questions, and why the run stopped. Feed durable
learnings to [`eval`](../eval/SKILL.md) → `/log-session`.
