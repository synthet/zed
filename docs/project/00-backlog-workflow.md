# Backlog workflow

The canonical task queue is the project's configured **backlog provider**, not ad hoc `TODO.md`
notes. The full agent-facing rules live in the
[`backlog-queue`](../../.claude/skills/backlog-queue/SKILL.md) skill; provider-specific setup lives
under [`.agent/backlog/`](../../.agent/backlog/README.md).

## Default provider choices

- **Local Markdown** for generic/offline projects.
- **GitHub Issues** for GitHub-hosted projects without a board.
- **GitHub Projects** only when the project explicitly adopts a board provider.

Missing GitHub Projects board IDs are not mandatory for generic projects. Fill them only when using
[the GitHub Projects provider](../../.agent/backlog/providers/github-projects.md).

## Synth Zed

This repository's daily queue is the **Local Markdown** provider:
[`.agent/backlog/items.md`](../../.agent/backlog/items.md), following
[`providers/local-markdown.md`](../../.agent/backlog/providers/local-markdown.md). GitHub Issues and
Discussions are both disabled on [synthet/zed](https://github.com/synthet/zed), so neither is a work
source. Claim with `/task-claim <item-ref>` and reference the local ID in the PR body
(`Refs L-001`). Do not invent a parallel `specs/` tree.

## The five-step contract

1. **Pick** from the provider's ready queue, sorted by priority. If empty, ask the maintainer — do not
   invent work.
2. **Claim** the item (`/task-claim <item-ref>`): records ownership in the provider.
3. **In Progress** on your first commit.
4. **Blocked** → mark the item blocked and record the blocker + what would unblock it.
5. **Reference** the item in the PR (`Refs <ID>` or `Closes #<N>`); move it to review/done according
   to provider rules.

## Provider setup

| Provider | Use when | Setup |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Local Markdown | Generic/offline project | [`.agent/backlog/providers/local-markdown.md`](../../.agent/backlog/providers/local-markdown.md) |
| GitHub Issues | GitHub issue tracker is the queue | [`.agent/backlog/providers/github-issues.md`](../../.agent/backlog/providers/github-issues.md) |
| GitHub Projects | Optional board fields/stages are needed | [`.agent/backlog/providers/github-projects.md`](../../.agent/backlog/providers/github-projects.md) |

Provider-specific IDs, labels, `gh project` commands, and stage field option IDs belong in the
provider files, not in this generic workflow.
